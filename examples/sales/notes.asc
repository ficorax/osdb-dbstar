SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880901    
system order.  He needs about seventy systems in all and we
SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880901    
must be able to deliver.  I checked inventory and back orders
SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880901    
and potential orders (Steelers National Bank has a potentially
SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880901    
large MAC II order possible).  I told him we could deliver.
SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880901    
He asked for a quote and wants it delivered in person.

terminal in their serviced cities will have one system.  There
SKK      NYJ      OBRIAN        19880908
